Welcome to Actions Adventures! This series of coding adventures is all about learning new concepts and languages by using [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) to help you automate your workflow from idea to production. Let's get started!

## Choose Your Own Actions Adventure

### 1. Enter the Adventure Arena

To get started, enter the "adventure arena" by clicking the button below. This will create a GitHub Codespace that you can work in. Once it loads select the **Create codespace** button.

[![Enter Adventure Arena](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?style=for-the-badge&label=Enter+Adventure+Arena&message=Open&color=brightgreen&logo=github)](https://codespaces.new/se-actions-workshops/actions-mission-to-mars)

**NOTE:** You can use 60 hours of GitHub Codespaces [for free](https://github.com/features/codespaces#pricing) each month.

If you'd prefer, you can clone the repo and run locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/se-actions-workshops/actions-mission-to-mars
```

### 2. Choose an Adventure

**Pre-Reqs:** 
- A GitHub account
- A basic understanding of how to navigate GitHub (e.g., how to find the Actions tab, how to open and edit files)
- Some experience with YAML files, or willingness to learn (as GitHub Actions configurations are written in YAML)

### 3. Start Coding

Read Your Actions Adventure description, the high-Level tasks to perform, and the GitHub Actions hints to help you write your code.

- Use [GitHub Copilot](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/getting-started-with-github-copilot) and/or [GitHub Copilot Chat](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/github-copilot-chat/using-github-copilot-chat) to help you write the code for the adventure. You can use any language you'd like. Try learning a new language if you're up for the challenge (more on that below)!
- Leave any comments in your code to explain your thought process and show prompts that GitHub Copilot used to help you out.

### 4. Run Your Adventure Solution 

Test out your solution by running your actions and extend the workflows as needed!
